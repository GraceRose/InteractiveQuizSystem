Development Journal:

6 February 2015
	This the git hub repository was created. Development of questions is continuing, and I am conducting research on
how to create a GUI for the program. Additionally, I am creating the format to export it to an HTML based website. I have
also discussed the testing of this program with the Human Geography teacher at Capital, Mr. Faulkner. I am creating the
basic API or structure I have planned for the code. I plan on having the questions and basic terminal working by next week
and the form for entering questions and embedding links as a resource for information. I am compliling these links and the 
correct answers to the questions.I am also trying to figure out how to work with GitHub and looking into making this into a 
Windows applet thing. My goals for next week are: Start BlueJ program, create some questions, collect information, and 
figure out how to test.

	This week, I became more familiar with the workings of git hub and how to efficiently add, commit, and push code to 
the git hub repository. I also created a point system, and worked on creating the main class.  With the experience gained 
from the Grocery List program that we recently completed in class, I will start structuring the export to HTML feature to 
display the user's results. Additionally, this week, I will conduct research online and ask Mr. Schreiber about creating a 
GUI for the quiz system. Not connected with the specific code itself, I will talk to my teachers about what functionalities 
would specifically benefit an instructor using this program. I will also start on the PowerPoint for the final presentation,
specifically focusing on the Development and initial idea behind the program. My goals for next week are: Create a third of 
the questions list, acquire  a list of potential functionalities, and test out the current main class that I have.
